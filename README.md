**Project Summary**

**Problem Statement:** Finding an affordable apartment is known to be incredibly difficult in Vancouver. Itâ€™s especially difficult for first-time searchers in students, who often are forced to look for non-dorm residences due to shortages of on-campus housing. The housing search is a time-consuming process that involves going on multiple different sites, sifting through scam housing, and maintaining a mini-housing CRM.

**Solution:** The domain of our application (STUHOUSING) - helps students find housing in school areas by acting as a compiler of all housing available on various different platforms and supporting your search management (from discovery and visits to signing the eventual contract). A school support contact (employee) will act as the middle-man to all the different platforms for our minimum viable product. In the future, post this course, we hope to automate this role.

**Database:** Our database will model a school-wise application allowing a student to query for housing to meet their specifications and then manage the search process (including visits, applications, and signing the contract). The applications will not be integrated to other platforms yet, as it is assumed this will be done by the school support contact

**Result:** We built a web app to address the issue. The application can be accessed at the following link:https://www.students.cs.ubc.ca/~kitachi/src/signin.php
